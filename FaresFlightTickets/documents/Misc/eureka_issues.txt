1) com.netflix.discovery.shared.transport.TransportException: Cannot execute request on any known server
sol) Restart both config & eureka server.

2) Caused by: feign.RetryableException: Read timed out executing GET http://
sol) Don't forget Zuul is using Hystric underneath - so you may well have a Hystrix timeout instead (1000ms by default). You can either disable the timeout feature of Hystrix or increase its value:
# Disable Hystrix timeout globally (for all services)
hystrix.command.default.execution.timeout.enabled=false

# Disable Hystrix timeout for a single service
hystrix.command.<serviceName>.execution.timeout.enabled=false

# Increase the Hystrix timeout to 60s (globally)
hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds: 60000

# Increase the Hystrix timeout to 60s (per service)
hystrix.command.<serviceName>.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds: 60000
