The Oracle Express Edition installation automatically comes with "system" & "sys" accounts. During installation, we have to enter common password for both accounts. The standard password is "manager". However you can set different password.

Once installation completes, the %ORACLE_HOME%\bin folder should be automatically added to path.
C:\>echo %PATH%
C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\bin

Oracle installation provides 3 components such as:
	1) Oracle DB			[1521]
	2) Oracle Web Server		[8080]
	3) Oracle Microsoft Server	[2030]

Check whether oracle services are started or not.
Run--> services.msc
OracleServiceXE --"Started" status --> Statup type is "Automatic"
OracleXETNSListener --"Started" status --> Statup type is "Automatic"

Also check two files after ORACLE installation:
1) %ORACLE_HOME%\NETWORK\ADMIN\tnsnames.ora
   The above file contains HOST name, DB Port number (default 1521), SERVICE_NAME( default is 'XE' in case of expression edition)
   Note: If at all computer host name is changed through settings then changing HOST in tnsnames.ora file is needed.
   Note: By default The 'OracleServiceXE' status is Running with Startup Type is Automatic. Otherwise we need to edit tnsnames.ora file.

2) %ORACLE_HOME%\NETWORK\ADMIN\listener.ora
   The above file contains HOST name, DB Port number (default 1521)  DEFAULT_SERVICE_LISTENER (default is 'XE')
   Note: If at all computer host name is changed through settings then changing HOST in listener.ora file is needed.
   Note: By default The 'OracleXETNSListener' status is Running with Startup Type is Automatic. Otherwise we need to edit listener.ora file.
